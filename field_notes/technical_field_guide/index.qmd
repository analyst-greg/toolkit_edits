# Introduction

“There’s gold in them thar hills!” Once a rallying cry for 1800s prospectors, this phrase now fits a new kind of treasure hunt: digging through data for donor insights. First shouted by Dr. Matthew Stephenson (not Twain!), it urged people to look for value right where they stood. Today, prospect researchers do the same...only the hills are spreadsheets, endless tabs, and digitally entangled tools.

This guide is your scrappy survival kit for the wild world of philanthropic research. Inside: practical tips for multi-platform sleuthing, budget hacks, keyboard wizardry, light scripting, automation, and decoding data brokers. Whether you're chasing wealth, connections, or clarity, this is your map to finding gold in the data mines (and a way to do so on the cheap).

You’ll learn how to build donor personas and affinity scores, track engagement across multiple channels, and evaluate executive compensation and company affiliations. We’ll explore how to mine Form 990s and foundation databases, and how to make judgment calls when the data gets fuzzy. You’ll also get a deep dive into the tools of the trade: from CRMs like Salesforce and Blackbaud to platforms like LinkedIn Sales Navigator, Lexis Nexis, iWave, and Kaleidoscope.

For solo researchers, you may where multiple hats: prospect management, database admin, etc. This guide aims to be comprehensive enough that you could open up a new prospect development division in a non-profit or institution, and have all the tools you need to do it yourself, hire team members, and manage projects. Given the rapidly changing nature of the field, the field guide is intended to be updated annually. The first iteration may be more like a pamphlet with big dreams of being a full book, but we all have to start somewhere, right?
