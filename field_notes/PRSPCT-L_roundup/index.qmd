I've included links to the posts, so you can follow the original conversation. Not sure how folks would like me to attribute their contributions, so in lieu of posting names / job titles here, I figure folks can follow the links and log into PRSPCT-L to thank folks directly. In every case, I am transforming the content somehow, not directly quoting.
