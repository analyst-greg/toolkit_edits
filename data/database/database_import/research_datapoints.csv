It is not required by law and it does not create a companys legal existence
A company may have multiple D U N S numbers for subsidiaries branches or locations
The number itself is not confidential and is meant to be shared
Companies do not pay to receive a D U N S number but data products built on it often cost money
D U N S numbers are widely used by financial data providers governments banks procurement platforms and technology companies
They act as a stable global reference key to organize company data and corporate hierarchies
They are sometimes compared to a social security number for a company but the comparison is only loosely accurate""
