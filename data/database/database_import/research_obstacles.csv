1," ""Overkill Problem"""," ""Request Management"""," ""Requests come in from front-line fundraisers that are not appropriate for the stage of the prospect at hand. If they haven't ever talked with a prospect, and they want contact information and an entire novel on the prospect's history, that may be overkill considering they are not yet qualified. This is a constant push and pull between fundraisers and prospect dev folk - and can be a pretty gnarly problem. If you don't negotiate the standards for the kind of research you provide, when you provide it, and what precipitates the necessity of that research - those standards will be assumed and decided for you ad hoc by fundraisers - and you will be buried in research that they may not even use. So there's some compromise that needs to happen."""," """"",,

3,"""Prospect Enigma""","""Deep Research""","""The more wealth someone has, the more resources they have (e.g. via lawyers and financial consultants). Most people don't have the time or knowledge to effectively remove their information from data brokers, but it is much more common among wealthy people that guard their privacy and employ resources to do so. If a prospect is an 'enigma' - it usually means their details are not flowing into the datastreams you have access to, you are querying incorrectly for that prospect, they have a name that is mispelled on documentation and it confuses any searches, or half a dozen other things. However, it's always true that these individual names can be time-sinks and contribute to the 'rabbit-hole' problem.""",,,

5,"""Formatting Timesink""","""Communication""","Formatting can be a huge timesink, especially when there are constant debates about format. Profiles that change format can also impact longterm data storage, because it creates an adhoc variety in the kind of data you save to the database. Worst of all, it's essentially meaningless work that is only noticeable when something is glaringly wrong, or people have picadillos. The simple answer, in my opinion, would be to automate formatting, or use something where you can explicitly get at the data while preserving metadata. Markdown seems like a better option, because you can export to word, pdf, whatever, and easily extract the text with automated tools... there is a massive issue with creating the profile in word or as a pdf first, and then later uploading the profile to the database. The information should be structured and added to the database, and then the profiles generated.",,,

7,"""Project management snafus""","""Planning""","Project management is difficult! To keep track of long-term projects while also fulfilling daily requests with short turnaround times is a juggling act, and without good planning, many things can seem like they are too big to tackle. In reality, big projects are essentially the same as your average research request, the request just happens to be coming from ""inside the house"" and may not always have the same priority as critical items from leadership.","Project management is best done following specific principles, and using specialized software. Many ticketing systems these days (e.g. Jira) let you do a combination of getting external requests and tracking / planning for internal projects, all in the same system. That simplifies things. The closer your proactive projects are to the request process, the more likely they are to get done, or else risk becoming ""pie in the sky""",,
8,"""Timeliness problem""","""Request Management""","Profiles start aging out of accuracy as soon as they are written. In rare instances, a gift or significant event may happen between the time you have drafted the profile and the delivery date. These events are easy to miss, and can be hard to verify if they are not entered into the database in a timely fashion - often by other people in the chain (e.g. fundraisers uploading contact reports). As a result, sometimes even double or triple checking all the info just before delivery of the research product may mean that, when the report is actually read (e.g. a week from the delivery date) it may seem inaccurate or like the research team missed something. Some of this is unavoidable, but there may be some steps that can be taken to ensure better timeliness and accuracy.",Info verfication process...add more here,,
9,"""Reputational Hazard problem""","""Due Dilligence""","Reputational hazards are a growing problem in fundraising, due in large part to how social media can make things go viral - e.g. if a prominent donor has political or legal controversies. However, the principle of due dilligence remains the same as it ever was - protecting your institution by tracking threats to reputation and deciding on a plan of action. The problem is not really knowledge, or even capability, any researcher can dig up adverse media, since adverse media often gets more traction and reach across the internet. The problem is doing due dilligence at scale, and the biggest problem of all: what to do once you find the information. Without leadership buy-in, due dilligence can be seen as an inconvenient truth, and deemphasized. ",,,
10,"""Database Accuracy problem""","""Daily Woes""","Internal databases are never completely lined up with reality - data gets old fast, and the mechanisms for keeping it fresh can get complex quickly at scale. This problem is an interesting one, because it is a prospect research problem that doubles as an information services problem.",,,
11,"""LLM issues""","""Deep Research""","Besides the issues of compliance, environmental ethics, and financial feasibility - LLMs intended to save a prospect researcher time currently still have some major limitations. Depending on the platform, AI generated profiles are still subject to hallucinations, making them more work to verify when you can't trust them. The best generated profiles take a conservative approach to the information found, or provide confidence levels and sources for each data point, to reduce time in double checking. LLMs (in combination with other AI enterprise-level tools) can't replace the average prospect researcher yet, but they are moving along at a fast clip and are transforming the job. ",,,
