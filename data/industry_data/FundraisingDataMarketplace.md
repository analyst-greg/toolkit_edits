From ChatGPT, after prompting about surveying the fundraising data marketplace.

---
Here are **citations you can use to support the framing statement** about fundraising intelligence being a niche within larger data ecosystems and how fundraising tools draw on broader business, financial, and investigative data markets.

---

## **Citations Supporting Key Points**

### **Fundraising Intelligence as a Data-Driven Practice**

Fundraising and prospect research are explicitly described as involving **data analytics and business intelligence methods** to identify, analyze, and prioritize potential donors. This illustrates how fundraising adopts general analytic approaches from larger intelligence fields. ([DataCalculus][1])

**Citation:**
Prospect research has evolved to include advanced data analytics and BI methods for donor identification and engagement. ([DataCalculus][1])

---

### **Prospect Research Tools and Market Context**

Multiple survey and overview pages list and describe **specialized prospect research software** used by nonprofits, situating them within a broader landscape of data-driven tools. This supports your point that nonprofit platforms are part of a larger technology ecosystem rather than isolated inventions. ([Double the Donation][2])

**Citations:**

* Specialized fundraising tools now rely on integrated data and analytics to help nonprofits focus on high-value prospects. ([Double the Donation][2])
* Prospect research tools include software, data appending services, and integration with donor databases—all drawing on underlying business data sources. ([DonorSearch][3])

---

### **Business Intelligence as Foundational Technology**

Descriptions of **business intelligence (BI)** show how broad data aggregation and analysis tools are used across sectors, and by analogy how similar practices underlie fundraising analytics. This supports the point that fundraising borrows from general BI. ([Data Stack Hub][4])

**Citations:**

* Business intelligence refers broadly to data collection, analysis, visualization, and decision support across organizations. ([Data Stack Hub][4])
* Open-source BI tools connect to many data sources and support reporting and analytic workflows. ([FanRuan Software][5])

---

### **Examples of Larger Business Intelligence Databases**

While not strictly academic, public descriptions of widely used business data platforms (such as Crunchbase) illustrate how rich business datasets exist outside nonprofit-specific tooling and underlie broader intelligence work. ([Wikipedia][6])

**Citation:**
Crunchbase is a public/private business intelligence database of companies and startups used across industries for market research and analysis. ([Wikipedia][6])

---

## **Possible Additional Academic Support (Contextual)**

Although not specific to fundraising, scholarly work on **open-source intelligence ecosystems and curated intelligence databases** demonstrates how specialized domains can be supported by broader intelligence infrastructure. This analogy reinforces your argument about niche markets drawing on shared technical foundations. ([arXiv][7])

**Citation:**
The *Intelligence Studies Network* shows how intelligence fields build shared infrastructure and curated resources using open-source tools and data. ([arXiv][7])

---

## **How You Could Cite These in Your Text**

Here are examples of how you might weave them into your framing:

> Modern fundraising and prospect research increasingly relies on **data analytics and business intelligence techniques** to identify and prioritize prospective donors, moving beyond intuition toward structured analytic workflows derived from broader BI practice. ([DataCalculus][1])

> Specialized fundraising tools sit atop wider data markets: they leverage integrated datasets and analytic services much like other sectors do for **strategic decision-making and insight generation**. ([Double the Donation][2])

> Business intelligence encompasses a wide range of **data integration, visualization and analytics capabilities**, illustrating the larger infrastructure that fundraising analytics borrows from. ([Data Stack Hub][4])

> Public business intelligence platforms such as Crunchbase show how **rich commercial datasets** are used across industries, including research functions often repurposed in academic and nonprofit environments. ([Wikipedia][6])

If the **analysis is primary** and the **paper is a downstream artifact** then the outline should reflect a **living research program**, not a one off publication.

Below is a structure that is deliberately **analysis first**, **paper second**, and explicitly incorporates everything we discussed about data brokers, financial intelligence services, fundraising tools, and pricing opacity.

I will separate **the research program architecture** from **the eventual paper outline** so you can evolve the work without being constrained by publication format.

---

# I. Research Program Architecture (Primary)

Think of this as the **scaffold you actually build and maintain**.

## 1. Core research question

How is fundraising intelligence data priced structured and bundled and how does that pricing reflect deeper market dynamics in data brokerage and financial intelligence ecosystems

This framing lets you pivot across:

* Economics
* Information systems
* Governance
* Ethics
* Market design

without changing the underlying dataset.

---

## 2. Object of study

Define the market *operationally* not rhetorically.

### Market boundary

* Prospect research data
* Wealth screening services
* Alumni employment verification
* Donor enrichment and scoring
* Embedded intelligence within CRMs

Explicitly **exclude**:

* Pure marketing lists
* Consumer ad tech
* Public filings databases without enrichment

This distinction matters for credibility.

---

## 3. Data lineage model

You already have this conceptually. Formalize it.

Primary sources
→ Data brokers
→ Financial intelligence style enrichment
→ Fundraising platforms
→ End users

This is your **analytic backbone**. Everything else attaches to it.

---

## 4. Pricing observation layer

This is the heart of the project.

### Raw pricing inputs

* Vendor quotes
* Contracts or invoices
* RFP responses
* Public nonprofit disclosures
* Interview reported price bands
* Historical snapshots

### Normalize across dimensions

* Organization size
* Records screened
* Attributes appended
* Update frequency
* Integration depth

Treat this as a **time series dataset**, even if sparsely populated at first.

---

## 5. Analytical lenses

You will return to these repeatedly.

### Market structure

* Bundling vs unbundling
* Vertical integration
* Switching costs
* Lock in via CRM ecosystems

### Pricing mechanics

* Subscription vs usage
* Price discrimination
* Opaque negotiation
* Value based pricing claims

### Information asymmetry

* Vendors know prices
* Buyers do not
* Donors are unaware

This directly connects to data market theory.

---

## 6. Comparative anchors

You need comparison points to avoid being seen as niche.

Use:

* General data marketplace pricing theory
* Financial intelligence data pricing
* OSINT monetization models
* LEI DUNS identity markets

You are not claiming uniqueness you are showing **structural similarity**.

---

## 7. Governance and ethics layer

Not moralizing but analytical.

* Consent structures
* Data provenance
* Regulatory oversight gaps
* Nonprofit exceptionalism narratives

This expands the relevance of the work.

---

## 8. Iterative outputs

Your project should produce:

* Internal memos
* Working datasets
* Visualizations
* Method notes
* Interim blog posts if desired

The paper comes *last*.

---

# II. Eventual Paper Outline (Secondary Artifact)

This is how the analysis collapses into a publishable form.

## 1. Introduction

* Fundraising intelligence is a large but understudied data market
* Pricing is opaque yet consequential
* This paper provides the first structured analysis of pricing in this domain

State the contribution narrowly and defensibly.

---

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Data brokers and data markets

Draw from general pricing surveys and broker literature.

### 2.2 Financial intelligence and OSINT

Show conceptual overlap with AML and FININT markets.

### 2.3 Fundraising and prospect research

Demonstrate descriptive gap not ignorance.

---

## 3. Market and Data Description

### 3.1 Actors and data flows

Reuse your lineage model.

### 3.2 Products and bundles

Define what is being priced.

---

## 4. Data and Methods

### 4.1 Data sources

Be explicit about estimation and uncertainty.

### 4.2 Normalization methodology

This is where novelty lives.

### 4.3 Limitations

Disarm reviewers early.

---

## 5. Pricing Structures and Patterns

### 5.1 Price levels and dispersion

### 5.2 Bundling strategies

### 5.3 Evidence of price discrimination

### 5.4 Lock in and switching costs

This is the analytic core.

---

## 6. Interpretation

### 6.1 Comparison to general data markets

### 6.2 Comparison to financial intelligence services

### 6.3 Implications for nonprofits

You are synthesizing not advocating.

---

## 7. Governance and Policy Implications

* Transparency
* Accountability
* Sector specific regulation
* Risks of unexamined intelligence markets

Keep this restrained.

---

## 8. Conclusion

* Restate contributions
* Emphasize dataset and method
* Point to future research

---

# III. Why this works as an ongoing project

* You can add vendors without rewriting theory
* You can add years of data
* You can fork analyses for ethics economics or policy
* You are building **infrastructure for insight**, not just a paper

The paper is just one compression of the work.

---

## One sentence synthesis

You are not writing a paper about fundraising tools; you are **building the first empirical window into a hidden data market**, and the paper is simply how that window eventually gets formal recognition.

---

No peer reviewed paper that I can find **systematically catalogs the exact data fields provided by prospect research / fundraising vendors** (e.g., WealthEngine DonorSearch iWave ResearchPoint LiveAlumni) and maps them side-by-side. What *does* exist are vendor data dictionaries product datasheets KB articles and practitioner guides that together let you construct the field-level map yourself. ([Blackbaud Web Files][1])

Below I’ll give a compact evidence-backed plan for how to build that mapping the typical field set you’ll find across vendors and a recommended data model so you can start collecting or estimating pricing and coverage in parallel.

# Evidence summary (why no academic catalog exists)

* Academic work focuses on general data pricing theory and marketplaces not on vendor by vendor field inventories for fundraising intelligence. See the data pricing surveys for methods not field lists. ([WealthEngine][2])
* Vendor level detail is available but scattered: product datasheets KB articles API docs and integration guides contain the canonical field lists. You need to gather those primary vendor docs and normalize them. Examples include ResearchPoint field lists WealthEngine manuals DonorSearch definitions iWave field mapping and LiveAlumni integration pages. ([Blackbaud Web Files][1])

# Typical field categories you will encounter (use these as canonical column headers in your mapping)

1. Identity & contact

   * full name legal name aliases email phone mailing address
2. Biographic & demographics

   * DOB approximate age gender household composition
3. Employment & firmographics

   * current employer title industry employer history job change timestamps. ([LiveAlumni][3])
4. Wealth indicators / capacity proxies

   * estimated net worth estimated investable assets income real estate holdings stock ownership business ownership luxury asset flags
   * prebuilt scores or pyramids (WealthEngine scores etc.). ([WealthEngine][2])
5. Philanthropic history

   * recorded major gifts pledged and paid giving to named orgs dates gift amounts publicly reported donations political donations and charity board service. ([SofterWare Uploads][4])
6. Engagement & affinity signals

   * event attendance volunteer roles memberships subscription interactions volunteer/board affiliations
7. Relationship & network data

   * household links household members board memberships executive relationships corporate board links shared addresses
8. Identifiers & crosswalks

   * D-U-N-S LEI tax or registry IDs stock tickers CIK (SEC) internal vendor ids
9. Derived scores & models

   * propensity to give scores wealth scores capacity bands match-gift eligibility
10. Provenance & confidence metadata

* last verified timestamp source type (public record scraped user supplied vendor inferred) match quality score. ([Trail Blazer][5])

# Suggested mapping data model (table schema)

Columns (your canonical master schema)

* vendor_name
* vendor_field_name
* canonical_field (one of the categories above e.g. current_employer)
* data_type (string number date boolean)
* cardinality (single value multiple values)
* provenance (public_record broker_scrape vendor_contributed)
* freshness (update_frequency e.g., realtime monthly)
* coverage_notes (geography coverage sector limits)
* sample_value (example)
* price_implied (if you have price per record or per attribute)
* confidence_interval (estimate quality)

Use the canonical_field column to normalize synonyms across vendors (e.g., Employer EmployerName CurrentEmployer → current_employer).

# How to build the map step by step (practical)

1. **Inventory vendor source docs**

   * Download KB articles API docs datasheets and data dictionaries (the vendors publish these). Start with ResearchPoint WealthEngine DonorSearch iWave LiveAlumni. ([Blackbaud Web Files][1])

2. **Automate extraction where possible**

   * Scrape HTML/ PDFs to extract field lists into CSV. Many vendor KB pages already list “fields” or “definitions” you can parse. ([Blackbaud Knowledgebase][6])

3. **Normalize to canonical schema**

   * Map each vendor_field_name → canonical_field. Record mapping rules and ambiguous cases.

4. **Add provenance and coverage**

   * For each field note the vendor’s stated source and geographic coverage. This is critical for comparing e.g., real estate data coverage across vendors.

5. **Add pricing and confidence**

   * Where you have price data attach it. If you only have ranges or estimates record them plus method (quote interview invoice). Use price_implied and confidence_interval fields.

6. **Produce visual outputs**

   * Heatmap of field coverage by vendor (rows vendors columns canonical fields)
   * Price per attribute or bundle scatterplots
   * Network map of who licenses from whom (if you can infer upstream brokers)

# What to expect in practice (pitfalls and quirks)

* **Synonym chaos** — the same concept is named differently across vendors and sometimes split into subfields. Normalization is the hardest part. ([Blackbaud Knowledgebase][6])
* **Provenance opacity** — vendors often do not fully disclose raw upstream sources for commercial reasons. You will need to rely on vendor statements and triangulation. ([WealthEngine][2])
* **Coverage heterogeneity** — some vendors have excellent US real estate or political giving coverage but weak international data. Capture geography explicitly. ([Blackbaud Web Files][1])

# Are there existing partial lists or practitioner guides?

Yes there are KB articles guides and vendor definition PDFs you can use as primary sources rather than academic citations. Representative examples: Blackbaud ResearchPoint field list WealthEngine user manual DonorSearch profile definitions iWave field mapping LiveAlumni integration docs. ([Blackbaud Knowledgebase][6])

# Quick next steps I can do for you right now (pick any)

* Pull and normalize field lists for 3 vendors you care about and return the mapping table.
* Create the blank canonical schema CSV you can fill with vendor data.
* Start the field coverage heatmap for 5 vendors.

If you want me to start mapping now tell me which vendors to prioritize and whether you already have any price observations. If you prefer I will start with the canonical five mentioned above: WealthEngine DonorSearch iWave ResearchPoint LiveAlumni.
