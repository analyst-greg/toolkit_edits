20,Cotality,,Potentially helpful to understand their data market places and how they sit within the larger landcscape of real estate data brokers however their intended product audience are other companies with cloud infastructure to process real estate data or build apps not direct to consumer.

33,Obsidian,,Useful as a research notebook because of it's features security (offline mode) and searchability within and between notes. The prospect research toolkit will eventually build a plug for Obsidian that is inteded to be helpful for taking notes while researching.,,,,
34,Kindsight,,"$4150 for 1 license, 1500 screens 750 live profiles. 3 users starts at $5350",,,,
35,BVResources.com,,"Has some free items and provides interesting context for market valuation as a field. Business Valuation is a tricky subject in prospect research, because the value of a business does not necessarily reflect any specific wealth in associated individuals - but business valuation research is still valuable for a number of other use-cases beyond capacity and I need to flesh them out on this website. Small, privately held company.",,,,

Corporate subsidiary family trees executive lists and stock information (with links to paperwork) recent news querying and you can follow their source update page to see exactly which sources are being used discontinued etc. Good for big companies where the research question needs to dive in and understand subsidiaries or the overarching nature of the business,,University of Utah,,

53,Assay,,from website: https://geisgetsresults.com/assay/ Assay’s algorithm evaluates and weighs Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Assay provides a propensity score which helps you target the right donors and select appropriate tactics for donor development.,,,,
54,Radar,,Probably overkill for due dilligence however it has an alert system that could be useful if reputational hazards are a high priority. It seems intended more for law firms hoping to find new clients and keep track of ongoing cindustry info and it's unclear if anyone in fundraising uses Radar for this purpose. My guess is it's too expensive for a more rare use-case and other tools (like the legal side of Lexis) maybe do a better job or are more familiar. A free trial is available though!,,,,
55,ScraperApi,,Good info on web scraping which is legal for public information as long as you abide by terms of service. Scraper api is an example of a paid resource for this but there are other options as well and almost all have free trials.,,,,
56,Octoparse,,,,,,
57,Loopnet,,Some free options. The usecase for this one is a little odd: if you want to check on the status of a company understanding if the commercial space is up for sale might offer some clues that are otherwise invisible at other sources. ,,,,

Otherwise quite limited for prospect research. ,,,,

The data is updated by industry experts and members of the site and is verified by each company.

94,Salutary Data,,"Supplies contact information for tools like Nexis Uni. Details from Pitchbook: Provider of business data services intended for businesses to connect. The company offers data including postal codes phone numbers email name title and company details. Founded in 2015. I have accessed their reports via Nexis Uni and their ""biographies"" include compensation information as well as job titles and LinkedIn URLs. Nexis lets you download the Salutary Data reports as RTF or DOCX or PDF bundled or as separate files. Unsure of how they source their information but those two data points: compensation and LinkedIn URL are interesting.",,,,

Law enforcement has their own variant, for example. Nexis Uni is the one scoped for college-level research and emphasizes the breadth of its legal sources. Unlike Nexis for Development Professionals, you cannot look up the personal info of specific people. It may be drawing from many of the same sources as ProQuest for its news articles, though how they stack up against each other has not yet been explored in this toolkit. Nexis Uni is an affiliate database to LexisNexis and contains select databases found in Lexis, including all federal and state case law, regulations, statutes and many legal journals.
