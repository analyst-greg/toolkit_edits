# Short-term Goals
- Synthetic donor dataset for training, examples, and presentations
- AI Prompt library and use-cases, as well as "helper files" for creating stronger research posture without having to initialize an entire agent
- Software tool comparisons, paid and free
- Templates
- Tutorials and Blog posts that will be refined and compiled into the field guide: [*"Prospectin' in Philanthropy Country"*](toolkit_blog/technical_field_guide/index.qmd)

***
# Long-term Goals
- Extensions or add-ins, or community plugins (potentially starting with Obsidian or Excel)
- Standalone app that integrates with free and paid tools
- Collaboration with other Apra chapters and Apra International
- A completed prospect research field guide that combines tools, blog posts, tutorials, and education into one cohesive whole - and can be downloaded as PDF as well as read online
- One-off donations to pay for site assets or coffee money if I get a friend to glance at the site and give advice, not planning for ongoing sponsorship for this site, which is currently maintained as a volunteer effort using free tools. No users will be solicited, but a link to a "buymeacoffee" will be set up.

# FAQ

## Why does this exist?

There are plenty of excellent paid resources available: Apra, private consultants, subscription tools, books, but not everyone has the budget to access them. This toolkit is being created to bridge that gap, or supplement what's already out there, not to replace any of those things. The goal is to keep it simple, open-source, community-driven, free and regularly updated.

## How accurate is this website?
There will be an entire write-up explaining how I source pricing information, but generally speaking, the prices on this website will be prone to errors and should be understood as estimates. The incidents, however, given their public nature, are a more reliable metric to contribute to the overall rating scheme of the software tools. I am most confident, of course, in the subjective articles and tutorials. However, since I am not an advanced data engineer or devops guy - there are almost certainly easier ways to gather, clean, and filter the data I'm sharing on this website. For website bugs or accuracy questions, feel free to open a new issue on the Github project page! (add link here, Greg)

In order of most to least accuracy (probably): 

1. General tool or feature information
2. Tutorials
3. Data breaches reported publicly by the press
4. Service outages reported by users to public websites or from the companies themselves
5. Pricing information

## Who is this guy anyway?

I come from a psychology background and am largely self-taught in data analytics, information science, data science, etc. This website is guaranteed to have some bugs.

## How often is the website updated?

In small ways, frequently! Larger changes and resources are on a slower schedule, since I'm doing this in my free time. I expect to have more tutorials, resources, and tools online by 2026.

## How is Apra Utah involved?

I started this website as part of my education initiative for 2025 while I'm serving on the Apra Utah board, and hope to keep collaborating with Apra Utah after my term ends. The opinions expressed on this website are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of Apra Utah or my employer.
