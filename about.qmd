# FAQ

## Why does this exist?

There are plenty of excellent paid resources available: Apra, private consultants, subscription tools, books, but not everyone has the budget to access them. This toolkit is being created to bridge that gap, or supplement what's already out there, not to replace any of those things. The goal is to keep it simple, open-source, community-driven, free and regularly updated.

## Who is this guy anyway?

I come from a psychology background and am largely self-taught in data analytics, information science, data science, etc. This website is guaranteed to have some bugs.

## How often is the website updated?

In small ways, frequently! Larger changes and resources are on a slower schedule, since I'm doing this in my free time. I expect to have more tutorials, resources, and tools online by 2026.

## How is Apra Utah involved?

I started this website as part of my education initiative for 2025 while I'm serving on the Apra Utah board, and hope to keep collaborating with Apra Utah after my term ends. The opinions expressed on this website are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of Apra Utah or my employer.
