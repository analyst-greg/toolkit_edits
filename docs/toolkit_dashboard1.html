Better for public companies.","","","","Potentially helpful to understand their data market places and how they sit within the larger landcscape of real estate data brokers however their intended product audience are other companies with cloud infastructure to process real estate data or build apps not direct to consumer. Useful to understand them if one were to attempt to build a competitor to something like iWave and you need to pay for data.","","","","","","","","","","","Hootsuite bought talkwalker in 2024, branding it as \"Hootsuite Listening powered by Talkwalker\"","Useful as a research notebook because of it's features security (offline mode) and searchability within and between notes. The prospect research toolkit will eventually build a plug for Obsidian that is inteded to be helpful for taking notes while researching.","$4150 for 1 license, 1500 screens 750 live profiles. 3 users starts at $5350","Has some free items and provides interesting context for market valuation as a field. Business Valuation is a tricky subject in prospect research, because the value of a business does not necessarily reflect any specific wealth in associated individuals - but business valuation research is still valuable for a number of other use-cases beyond capacity and I need to flesh them out on this website. Small, privately held company.","Many university libraries also have enterprise accounts and other large organizations can get a \"special rate\" but I haven't figured out what that is yet.","Bonterra also has a Fundraising and Engagement suite, EveryAction was acquired by Bonterra as part of a broader consolidaiton of nonprofit tech tools led by Bonterra and its investers","","","Chrome extension","Good for phone numbers can be cross-checked with lexis or iWave, people also use usphonebook.com","or emails (or competitors Snov.io or ZeroBounce or Bouncer) but hunter.io has a good free plan 25 searches a month, and 50 email vertifications which is better than rocket reach","International mentioned on PRSPCT-L","","","Factiva is a business information and research platform that aggregates global news company data and market intelligence from thousands of sources. Corporate subsidiary family trees executive lists and stock information (with links to paperwork) recent news querying and you can follow their source update page to see exactly which sources are being used discontinued etc. Good for big companies where the research question needs to dive in and understand subsidiaries or the overarching nature of the business","","Extensive business info but Mergent Intellect arguably has one of the best executive searches letting you export files with hundreds of executives including their company phone number","PitchBook allows you to search private equity and investors venture capital deals, and information on mergers and acquisitions.

It seems intended more for law firms hoping to find new clients and keep track of ongoing cindustry info and it's unclear if anyone in fundraising uses Radar for this purpose. My guess is it's too expensive for a more rare use-case and other tools (like the legal side of Lexis) maybe do a better job or are more familiar. A free trial is available though!","Good info on web scraping which is legal for public information as long as you abide by terms of service. Scraper api is an example of a paid resource for this but there are other options as well and almost all have free trials.","","Some free options. The usecase for this one is a little odd: if you want to check on the status of a company understanding if the commercial space is up for sale might offer some clues that are otherwise invisible at other sources. ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ProQuest has dozens of databases, and institutions can choose to subscribe to specialized periodical databases or just default to the \"central\" list. The ProQuest Central database is the largest single periodical resource available, bringing together complete databases across all major subject areas, including Business, Health and Medical, Social Sciences, Education, Science and Technology, and Humanities. Notably, press release wires and international reach.","","","","","","","","","Helpful to understand industry market movers or big public companies. The most relevant datapoint for prospect research is the company financial health letter grade the ValueLine analysts provide in the bottom right corner of the ValueLine Investment Survey pdf - could be useful in an overview (e.g. A- financial health) or as a bullet point for supplemental descriptions of a company. Otherwise quite limited for prospect research. ","Surprisingly robust free options and pretty cheap paid ones honestly seems like a hidden gem. Limits its reach to public companies. From the probably outdated Wikipedia page: The Official Board is a France-based online contact database. The database maintains up-to-date corporate organizational and data charts for all the world's private and public companies exceeding $100 million in revenue which includes over 50,000 companies. The data is updated by industry experts and members of the site and is verified by each company. It is used to research organizational structures and find contact information for corporate executives.\n\nThe Official Board was founded by Amazon and Apple Inc. executive Thomas Lot in 2009. ","Supplies contact information for tools like Nexis Uni. Details from Pitchbook: Provider of business data services intended for businesses to connect. The company offers data including postal codes phone numbers email name title and company details. Founded in 2015. I have accessed their reports via Nexis Uni and their \"biographies\" include compensation information as well as job titles and LinkedIn URLs. Nexis lets you download the Salutary Data reports as RTF or DOCX or PDF bundled or as separate files. Unsure of how they source their information but those two data points: compensation and LinkedIn URL are interesting.","","Essentially the same tool as LexisNexis, one of the variants. Law enforcement has their own variant, for example. Nexis Uni is the one scoped for college-level research and emphasizes the breadth of its legal sources. Unlike Nexis for Development Professionals, you cannot look up the personal info of specific people. It may be drawing from many of the same sources as ProQuest for its news articles, though how they stack up against each other has not yet been explored in this toolkit. Nexis Uni is an affiliate database to LexisNexis and contains select databases found in Lexis, including all federal and state case law, regulations, statutes and many legal journals. Nexis Uni also contains over 15,000 news and business sources.","Newspaper Source provides cover-to-cover full text for more than 40 national (U.S.) and international newspapers, including the *The Sunday Times*, *USA Today*, *The Washington Post*, *The Arizona Daily Star*, *The Wyoming Tribune-Eagle*, *Minneapolis Star Tribune*, and more.
